# Solving PDEs and Wave Simulations

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and perform wave simulations. It includes various methods and applications, such as animating solutions and running specific models.

## Contents

This repository consists of the following Python scripts:

1. `animate_map.py`: A script to animate the solutions of the PDEs over time. 
2. `pde_2d_fast.py`: A script to solve 2D PDEs efficiently.
3. `run_G.py`: A script to run the G model. (Please provide more details about this model)
4. `run_GSG.py`: A script to run the GSG model. (Please provide more details about this model)
5. `s_wave_base.py`: A base script that defines the fundamental functions and classes for simulating S waves.
6. `s_wave_mine.py`: A customized version of the S wave simulation script.
7. `s_wave.py`: A script to simulate S waves.
8. `test1.py`,`test2.py` and test3.py: Scripts to test various functions and classes defined in the other scripts.
   

## Installation
